## About <a name = "about"></a>
---
Poricom is a desktop program for optical character recognition in manga images. Although it is a manga OCR application, it can recognize text on other type of images as well. The project is a GUI implementation of the [Manga OCR library](https://pypi.org/project/manga-ocr/0.1.5/) (supports Japanese only) and the Tesseract-API python wrapper [tesserocr](https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr) (supports other languages).
</br></br>

## User Guide  <a name="user_guide"></a>
---
Follow the installation instructions [here](#installation). Load a directory with manga images and select text boxes with Japanese text. If you are not getting good results using the default settings, [use the MangaOcr model](#load_model) to improve text detection.
